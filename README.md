# Mental-Health-Evaluation
POWER BI is great visualization tool for uncovering insights and providing data driven solution. This is why I am sharing with you this Mental health evaluation- Obsessive compulsive disorder report dashboard I created on Power BI. 
Obsessive compulsive disorder-OCD is a long lasting disorder in which a person experiences uncontrollabe and recurring thoughts (obsessions) and engages in repetitive behaviours (compulsions) or even both. 
This report shows that OCD is real, and many people even our next door neighbor may be suffering from it.
